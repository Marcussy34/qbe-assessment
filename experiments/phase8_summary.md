### üîç 4. Critical Discovery: Validation Strategy Impact

**Key Insight**: The breakthrough performance appears to be related to the validation methodology:

- **Phase 6 Method**: 85/15 stratified split on full dataset
- **Phase 8 Method**: Used last 20% of preprocessed data as validation set
- **Possible Explanation**: Different data ordering or leakage in validation split

**Data Consistency Check**:

- Test data: 13,580 samples, 14 features
- Same preprocessing pipeline applied consistently

### ‚ö†Ô∏è 5. Performance Validation Concerns

**Critical Analysis Needed**:

1. **Data Leakage**: The 79.94% accuracy may indicate potential data leakage in validation
2. **Temporal Ordering**: Using "last 20%" may not represent true holdout validation
3. **Preprocessing Consistency**: Need to verify preprocessing pipeline consistency
4. **True Generalization**: Requires testing on completely unseen data

**Recommended Actions**:

- Implement proper stratified cross-validation
- Verify no temporal dependencies in data ordering
- Test on original Phase 6 validation split for comparison
- Analyze feature importance for potential leakage sources

4. **OptimizedNet(256,128,64)** - Deep network at 78.28%
5. **BaselineNet(64)** - Small network at 61.45%

**Key Findings**:

- **Architecture Sweet Spot**: 128-256 hidden units optimal
