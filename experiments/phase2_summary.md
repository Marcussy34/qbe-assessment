=== PHASE 2: DATA EXPLORATION & UNDERSTANDING - COMPLETE ===

## Key Findings:

### Dataset Structure:
- Training data: 439,091 samples with 11 features
- Test data: 13,580 samples with 11 features  
- Target variable: is_correct (boolean)
- Target distribution: 51.15% correct, 48.85% incorrect (well balanced)

### Features Identified:

#### CRITICAL FINDING - User's Answer Feature:
- **feature1**: User's selected answer choice (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h)
- This is the MOST IMPORTANT feature for prediction
- Accuracy rates by choice are remarkably similar (~51%), suggesting good question design
- All choices (a-h) appear roughly equally often

#### Other Important Features:
- **feature4**: Number of answer choices per question (1-7 choices)
  * Most questions have 5 choices (205k samples)
  * Some questions have fewer choices (binary, 3-choice, etc.)
- **feature2**: Continuous numerical feature (likely difficulty/confidence score)
- **feature3**: Discrete numerical feature with 1,608 unique values
- **feature5**: Continuous numerical feature (some missing values: 16 in train, 25 in test)

#### Metadata Features:
- timestamp: When answer was submitted
- order_id: Sequence of answers (7,138 unique values)
- user_id: User identifier (5,052 unique users)
- question_id: Question identifier (11,472 unique questions)
- batch_id: Question batch identifier (8,329 unique batches)

### Data Quality:
- Very minimal missing data (only in feature5)
- No obvious outliers detected
- Clean, well-structured dataset
- Consistent formatting between train/test sets

### Key Insights for Modeling:
1. **feature1 (user's answer) is the primary predictive feature**
2. feature4 (number of choices) provides important context
3. Other numerical features likely capture question difficulty, user performance, etc.
4. Large number of unique users/questions suggests good generalization potential
5. Balanced target distribution is ideal for classification

### Preprocessing Requirements:
1. Encode feature1 (user's answer) appropriately 
2. Handle minimal missing values in feature5
3. Consider feature interactions between answer choice and number of options
4. Normalize/standardize numerical features (feature2, feature3, feature5)
5. Decide on handling of high-cardinality categorical features

### Next Steps for Phase 3:
- Implement preprocessing pipeline
- Create proper train/validation splits
- Engineer features based on answer choice patterns
- Prepare data for neural network training
